ngInclude.

[https://github.com/nginclude/nginclude.github.io](github)

# Contributing

Feel free to submit a PR with any desired changes, or get in touch with
anyone in the team to request being added to the organization

Currently the organizations are hardcoded in the data/organizations.json file, to add
information to the directory, add elements to the array and they should show up
in the list.

## Sample listing

The organizations for the directory use the following format, all fields are optional,
and default to empty strings.

```
{
  "name": "techqueria",
  "url": "http://techqueria.org",
  "display_url": "techqueria.org",
  "short_description": "Techqueria is a community for Latin@s in tech!",
  "long_description": "Calling all latin@s in tech! Whether you just got here last week or your family is been in the country for decades, we have a lot to share and be proud of. Come share your experiences with the community.",
  "logo": "http://techqueria.org/images/logo.png",
  "contact_name": "David Silva",
  "contact_data": "http://linkedin.com/in/dvidsilva",
  "location": "Bay Area, CA"
}
```
